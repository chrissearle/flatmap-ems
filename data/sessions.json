        "body": "\"Functional Programming\" is the modern received wisdom regarding program and language design. All the cool kids talk about writing code that is \"functional\" or even \"purely functional\". However, functional programming as it is traditionally defined really doesn't cut the mustard, and if you look at how modern functional architectures are being shaped, everyone seems to have tacitly arrived at the same conclusion: more is needed.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at how modern functional languages like Scala, Clojure and even Haskell have evolved beyond the simple paradigms of the lambda calculus. We will see how the industry has really moved beyond functional programming and into the realm of something more powerful, more expressive and better suited to the task of large application architecture.",
